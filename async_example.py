# In this example, an event loop is created using the asyncio.get_event_loop() function, and an asyncio.Event object is created to represent the event. Two tasks are defined: one that listens for the event using the await event.wait() statement, and one that triggers the event using the event.set() method.

# The listener and trigger tasks are then added to the event loop using the loop.create_task() method, and the event loop is started using the loop.run_forever() method. When the trigger_event task is run, it will set the event, which will cause the listen_for_event task to be called and print "The event was set!" to the console.

# This is just a simple example of how to use the asyncio module to create event listeners and triggers in Python. You can use this approach to create more complex event-driven programs that can run concurrently and asynchronously.

import asyncio

# Create an event loop
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

# Define an event that can be listened for and triggered
event = asyncio.Event()

# Define a task that will listen for the event
async def listen_for_event():
    # Wait for the event to be set using the await keyword
    await event.wait()

    # Do something when the event is set
    print("The event was set!")

# Define a task that will trigger the event
async def trigger_event():
    # Set the event, which will cause any tasks waiting for it to be called
    event.set()

# Add the listener and trigger tasks to the event loop
loop.create_task(listen_for_event())
loop.create_task(trigger_event())

# Start the event loop
loop.run_forever()
